| Environment (20%) | Section 2 | {{score}} / 20 |
| CVE Source and Conditions (20%) | Section 1 (CVE & PoC Sources), Section 2 (Requirements & Conditions) | {{score}} / 20 |
| Reproduction and Evidence (30%) | Section 3 (Steps & Commands), Section 4 (Results & Verification) | {{score}} / 30 |
| Patch Verification (20%) | Section 5 | {{score}} / 20 |
| Fourth Effect (10%) | Section 6 | {{score}} / 10 |

## 1. CVE and PoC Source

| Item | Content |
|---|---|
| CVE | {{cve_id}} |
| Official advisory | {{advisory_url}} |
| Affected versions | {{affected_versions}} |
| Patched version | {{patched_version}} |
| PoC source | {{poc_repository}} |

## 2. Environment and Requirements

I tested the PoC using the following environment:

| Item | Configuration | Verified |
|---|---|---|
| Architecture | `linux/amd64` | {{result}} |
| PHP | `8.3.35` | {{result}} |
| `memory_limit` | `8M` at request startup | {{result}} |
| `max_input_vars` | `1000` at request startup | {{result}} |
| `display_errors` | `On` at request startup | {{result}} |
| Moodle page overrides | `256M / 5000 / Off` | {{result}} |
| Apache | Single prefork worker | {{result}} |

These settings matter because {{explanation_of_requirements}}.

This environment differs from a default Moodle deployment. My results demonstrate {{supported_conclusion}}, but do not establish {{limitations}}.

## 3. Reproduction

I followed these steps to reproduce the vulnerability:

1. {{environment_setup}}
2. {{poc_execution}}
3. {{command_execution_and_flag}}
4. {{moodle_test_effect}}

Relevant commands:

```sh
{{commands_used}}
```

Observed output:

```text
{{execution_output}}
```

## 4. Experimental Evidence

### 4.1 Remote Code Execution

I tested remote command execution by running `id` through the PoC.

```text
{{id_output}}
```

The observed execution identity was {{execution_identity}}, which indicates {{conclusion}}.

### 4.2 Flag Retrieval

I attempted to retrieve the flag through the vulnerable service using {{method}}.

```text
{{flag_commands_and_output}}
```

This result was obtained by {{evidence_method}}, rather than directly reading the flag using Docker.

### 4.3 Moodle Impact

I tested {{effect_name}} on fictional Moodle data.

**Before:** {{original_state}}

**After:** {{modified_state}}

**Reset:** {{restored_state}}

```text
{{commands_and_evidence}}
```

I verified the effect using {{verification_method}} and checked the reset using {{reset_verification}}.

For the other in-class effects, {{brief_description_if_applicable}}.

## 5. Patch Verification

I compared PHP 8.3.35 with PHP 8.3.36.

| Observation | PHP 8.3.35 | PHP 8.3.36 |
|---|---|---|
| PHP version | {{version_before}} | {{version_after}} |
| PoC result | {{poc_before}} | {{poc_after}} |
| New execution proof | {{proof_before}} | {{proof_after}} |
| Moodle availability | {{moodle_before}} | {{moodle_after}} |

Commands used:

```sh
{{patch_and_verification_commands}}
```

Patched retest output:

```text
{{patched_test_output}}
```

I observed {{patch_observation}}. These results support {{patch_conclusion}}, subject to {{patch_limitations}}.

## 6. Fourth Effect (10%)

I implemented an additional effect on fictional Moodle test data.

| Item | Description |
|---|---|
| Effect | {{effect_name}} |
| Target data | {{target_data}} |
| Modified field | {{modified_field}} |
| Script or command | {{command_or_script}} |

**Before:** {{original_state}}

**After:** {{modified_state}}

**Reset:** {{restored_state}}

```text
{{fourth_effect_evidence}}
```

I verified the modification and reset using {{verification_method}}.

## 7. Analysis

My reproduction {{succeeded_or_failed}}.

The key observations were {{observations_and_poc_stages}}.

The vulnerability originates in PHP rather than Moodle because {{explanation}}.

I encountered {{problems}} and investigated them using {{troubleshooting_steps}}.

The evidence supports {{conclusion}}, with the following limitations: {{limitations}}.

## 8. Bonus (Optional)

### Bonus 1 — PoC Mechanism (+10%)

I investigated {{poc_stage_or_mechanism}}.

{{mechanism_explanation_and_evidence}}

### Bonus 2 — Additional Impact (+10%)

I explored {{additional_impact}}.

**Confirmed:** {{verified_evidence}}

**Not verified:** {{hypotheses_and_limitations}}
